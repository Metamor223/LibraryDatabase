# LibraryDatabase
  This project is a project, how not to write code, the Solid principle  
  and copying of methods from one method to another were almost not used here, so to speak -   
  **“for now it works in a hurry and that’s normal”**

  ## How it use
  Here i used **.Net Framework 4.8** and **MsSql**  
  You should change Name in connection string to your server name and create the table in MsSql - because it`s trash code  
  Tables you should create in MsSql, cause i didnt use the create command in code 

  ## And that all, dont write trash code
